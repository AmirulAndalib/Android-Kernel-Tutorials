<h2> ‚úÖ Downloading the kernel source code for your device</h2>

- **‚ö†Ô∏è If your device is Samsung,**

#### 01. Download the kernel source from here: [Samsung Opensource]( https://opensource.samsung.com/main)

<img src="./screenshots/1.png">

#### 02. Extract the ```Kernel.tar.gz``` from the source zip, unarchive it using this command:

```bash
tar -xvf Kernel.tar.gz && rm Kernel.tar.gz
```

<img src="./screenshots/2.png">

**Note:** It's a good idea to give the entire kernel directory 755 permissions to remove those üîí from the files and folders, preventing any issues when editing files and upstreaming the kernel.

**Do it this way:**

```
chmod +755 -R /path/to/extracted/kernel/
```

## ‚úÖ Understanding `non-GKI` & `GKI kernels`
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|          Android LTS Kernel Versions             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       non-GKI       |     GKI 1.0    |  GKI 2.0  |
+---------------------+----------------+-----------+
|         3.10        |       5.4      |   5.10    |
|         3.18        |                |   5.15    |
|         4.4         |                |   6.1     |
|         4.9         |                |   6.6     |
|         4.14        |                |           |
|         4.19        |                |           |
+---------------------+----------------+-----------+
```
#### Explanation:

1. **non-GKI**:
   - Includes older and heavily customized kernels used in Android devices before the GKI initiative.
   - Versions like **3.10**, **3.18**, **4.4**, **4.9**, **4.14**, and **4.19** are the most common (LTS Kernels).
   - These kernels are **device-specific** and often modified by OEMs (eg: Samsung).
   - These kernels are deprecated in Android Common Kernel repository.

2. **GKI 1.0**:
   - Google's first iteration of the Generic Kernel Image, starting with kernel version **5.4**.
   - **Note:** Some people says that **4.19** is also considered a **GKI 1.0** kernel, as it was used as a transitional kernel in early GKI implementations. But it didn't clear, and more context needed.
   - A few variants exist for certain SoC, like qGKI (Qualcomm GKI), and mGKI (Mediatek GKI), and was included with some features from that SoC.

3. **GKI 2.0**:
   - Google's second iteration of the Generic Kernel Image, starting with kernel version **5.10**.
   - Includes newer LTS kernel like **6.6**.

---

### Notes:
- **LTS = Long-Term Support**: These kernels are stable, well-maintained, and receive long-term updates.
- **GKI = Generic Kernel Image**: A unified kernel framework introduced by Google to standardize the kernel across Android devices.

## ‚úÖ Understanding the ```Kernel root```

<img src="./screenshots/6.png">

- As you can see in the above screenshot, it's the Linux kernel source code.
- It must have those folders, **highlighted in blue in the terminal.**
- **In GKI kernels,** the kernel root is located in a folder named "common".

- If you have a **GKI Samsung kernel**, you should use the "common" kernel instead of "msm-kernel" for building your kernel, and the build steps are the same as for a non-GKI kernel. [Refer to this repo for an idea](https://github.com/ravindu644/android_kernel_m145f_common).

<h2> ‚úÖ Compiling Part (Universal for any device).</h2>

### 01. After downloading or cloning the Kernel Source, we should have a build script to compile our kernel.

- Before creating a build script, we must determine the compatible compilers we will use to build our kernel.

- Run ```make kernelversion``` inside the kernel root to check your kernel version.

<img src="./screenshots/5.png">

- In my case, the kernel version is **5.4,** with qualcomm chipset, which is [qGKI](https://github.com/ravindu644/Android-Kernel-Tutorials#-understanding-non-gki--gki-kernels).

- You can find full information about **choosing the correct compiler for your kernel version** [here](./toolchains/) (based on my experience, btw).

  - **‚ùóMediatek users,** read [this](https://github.com/ravindu644/Android-Kernel-Tutorials/tree/main/toolchains#additional-notes).

- Keep in mind that **you don't need to manually download any of these toolchains** since my build scripts handle everything for you :)  

- Next, go to [build_scripts](./build_scripts/), choose the appropriate script, download it, and place it inside your kernel's root directory.

<img src="./screenshots/7.png">

<hr>

### 02. Edit the Build script:

**Open the build script in a text editor and make these changes:**  

- Replace `your_defconfig` to your current defconfig which is located in `arch/arm64/configs` In GKI 2.0 kernels, it's normally `gki_defconfig`

- But just in case, make sure to check `arch/arm64/configs` or `arch/arm64/configs/vendor`

- If your defconfig is located in the `arch/arm64/configs` directory, just replace `your_defconfig` with the name of your defconfig.

- If your defconfig is located in the `arch/arm64/configs/vendor` directory, replace `your_defconfig` like this:
  
  - `vendor/name_of_the_defconfig`
  - Example patch: [here](./patches/005.edit-defconfig.patch)

  <img src="./screenshots/12.png">

**‚ùóIf your device is Samsung Exynos, it doesn't support compiling the kernel in a separated 'out' directory. So, [edit your build script like this](./patches/001.nuke_out.patch)**  

---
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è [IMPORTANT] : *If your device is Samsung, it usually uses some device-specific variables in "some" kernels.*

- **As an example,** in the Galaxy S23 FE kernel source code, we can see they used variables called `TARGET_SOC=s5e9925`, `PLATFORM_VERSION=12`, and `ANDROID_MAJOR_VERSION=s`

- **If we didn't export those variables correctly,** the kernel failed to build in my case.

- Don't worry, they usually mention these required variables in their `README_Kernel.txt` or their own `build_kernel.sh`

  <img src="./screenshots/16.png">

**Refer to this example patch to properly integrate such variables into our build script:** [here](./patches/007.Define-OEM-Variables.patch)

**Note:** Just don't overthink it, even if they use values like 12 and S for Platform and Android versions, even if you have a higher Android version.

---

### 03. Edit the Makefile.

- If you find these variables: ```REAL_CC``` or ```CFP_CC``` in your "Makefile", remove them from the "Makefile", then Search for "wrapper" in your Makefile. If there's a line related to a Python file, remove that entire line/function as well.

    - Example patch of removing the wrapper: [click here](./patches/004.remove_gcc%20wrapper.patch)

- Search ```CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG``` and replace it with ```CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE```

    - Example patch of fix -fstack-protector-strong not supported by compiler: [click here](./patches/003.fix_fstack-protector-strong-not-supported-by-compiler.patch)

<hr>

### 03. Now, grant the executable permissions to ```build_xxxx.sh``` using this command.
  ```
  chmod +x build_xxxx.sh
  ```
### 04. Finally, run the build script using this command :
  ```
./build_xxxx.sh
```

<img src="./screenshots/8.png">

- When you run the script for the first time, it will begin to install all the necessary dependencies and start downloading the required toolchains, depending on your kernel version.

- Make sure not to interrupt the first run. If it gets interrupted somehow, delete the `toolchains` folder from "~/" and try again: ```rm -rf ~/toolchains```

<img src="./screenshots/9.png">

### After the initial run is completed, the kernel should start building, 

<img src="./screenshots/11.png">

### and the "menuconfig" should appear.

<img src="./screenshots/10.png">

- **Additional notes:**
    - You can completely ignore anything displayed as `warning:`
      - Eg: `warning: ignoring unsupported character '`
<hr>

## ‚úÖ Customizing the Kernel (Temporary Method)
- Once the *menuconfig* appears, you can navigate through it and customize the Kernel in a graphical way as needed.

- **As an example,** we can customize **the Kernel name, enable new drivers, enable new file systems, disable security features,** and more :)

#### You can navigate the *menuconfig* using the arrow keys (‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üì) on your keyboard and press `y` to enable, `n` to disable or `m` to enable as a module `<M>`.

### 1. Changing the Kernel name.

- I guess no explanation is needed for this:

    <img src="./screenshots/14.png" width="60%">

- Located in: `General setup  ---> Local version - append to kernel release`

<img src="./gif/1.gif">

### 2. Enabling BTRFS support.

- Btrfs is a modern Linux filesystem with copy-on-write, snapshots, and built-in RAID, ideal for reliability and scalability.

- Located in: `File systems  ---> < > Btrfs filesystem support`

<img src="./gif/2.gif">

### 3. Enabling more CPU Governors

- **CPU governors control how the processor adjusts its speed.**
-  You can choose between performance-focused governors (like "performance" for max speed) or battery-saving ones (like "powersave").

**Enabling more CPU Governors:**

- Located in: `CPU Power Management  ---> CPU Frequency scaling  ---> `

<img src="./gif/3.gif">

**Changing the Default CPU Governor:**

- Located in: `CPU Power Management  ---> CPU Frequency scaling  ---> Default CPUFreq governor (performance)  --->`

<img src="./gif/4.gif">

### 3. Enabling more IO Schedulers

- **IO schedulers control how your system handles reading and writing data to storage.**
- Different schedulers can make your system faster or help it run smoother, depending on what you're doing (like gaming, browsing, or saving battery).
- Located in: `IO Schedulers  --->`
