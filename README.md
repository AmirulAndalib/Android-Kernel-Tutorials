## A Beginner-Friendly Guide to Compiling Your First Android Kernel..!  

**What You'll Learn:**  

- Downloading the kernel source for your device (Samsung only)
- Understanding the kernel root & choosing the right compilers for compilation
- Customizing the kernel
- Remove Samsung's anti-root protections.  
- Implementing KernelSU (to-do)
- Creating a signed boot image from the compiled kernel

**What You'll Need:** 
- A working üß†
- Ubuntu/Debian based PC/Server
- Knowledge of basic commands in Linux, and Bash/Shell script knowledge
- Understanding of English.
- Patience

#### Additional Notes:

- You can also use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) if you don't want to install a Linux distro.  
  - Keep in mind, though, that it might be more challenging for beginners who are not familiar with the command-line interface.  
  - Access the terminal from Gitpod and its GUI using [ravindu644/LinuxRDP](https://github.com/ravindu644/LinuxRDP).

<h2> ‚úÖ Downloading Part. (Only for samsung)</h2>

### 01. Download the kernel source from the [Samsung Opensource]( https://opensource.samsung.com/main).
<img src="./screenshots/1.png">

### 02. Extract the ```Kernel.tar.gz``` from the source zip, unarchive it using this command.
```
tar -xvf Kernel.tar.gz && rm Kernel.tar.gz
```

<img src="./screenshots/2.png">

**Note:** It's a good idea to give the entire kernel directory 755 permissions to remove those üîí from the files and folders, preventing any issues when editing files and upstreaming the kernel.

**Do it this way:**

```
chmod +755 -R /path/to/extracted/kernel/
```

## ‚úÖ Understanding `non-GKI` & `GKI kernels`
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|          Android LTS Kernel Versions             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       non-GKI       |     GKI 1.0    |  GKI 2.0  |
+---------------------+----------------+-----------+
|         3.10        |       5.4      |   5.10    |
|         3.18        |                |   5.15    |
|         4.4         |                |   6.1     |
|         4.9         |                |   6.6     |
|         4.14        |                |           |
|         4.19        |                |           |
+---------------------+----------------+-----------+
```
#### Explanation:

1. **non-GKI**:
   - Includes older and heavily customized kernels used in Android devices before the GKI initiative.
   - Versions like **3.10**, **3.18**, **4.4**, **4.9**, **4.14**, and **4.19** are the most common (LTS Kernels).
   - These kernels are **device-specific** and often modified by OEMs (eg: Samsung).
   - These kernels are deprecated in Android Common Kernel repository.

2. **GKI 1.0**:
   - Google's first iteration of the Generic Kernel Image, starting with kernel version **5.4**.
   - **Note:** Some people says that **4.19** is also considered a **GKI 1.0** kernel, as it was used as a transitional kernel in early GKI implementations. But it didn't clear, and more context needed.
   - A few variants exist for certain SoC, like qGKI (Qualcomm GKI), and mGKI (Mediatek GKI), and was included with some features from that SoC.

3. **GKI 2.0**:
   - Google's second iteration of the Generic Kernel Image, starting with kernel version **5.10**.
   - Includes newer LTS kernels like **6.6**.

---

### Notes:
- **LTS = Long-Term Support**: These kernels are stable, well-maintained, and receive long-term updates.
- **GKI = Generic Kernel Image**: A unified kernel framework introduced by Google to standardize the kernel across Android devices.

## ‚úÖ Understanding the ```Kernel root```

<img src="./screenshots/6.png">

- As you can see in the above screenshot, it's the Linux kernel source code.
- It must have those folders, **highlighted in blue in the terminal.**
- **In GKI kernels,** the kernel root is located in a folder named "common".

- If you have a **GKI Samsung kernel**, you should use the "common" kernel instead of "msm-kernel" for building your kernel, and the build steps are the same as for a non-GKI kernel. [Refer to this repo for an idea](https://github.com/ravindu644/android_kernel_m145f_common).

<h2> ‚úÖ Compiling Part (Universal for any device).</h2>

### 01. After downloading or cloning the Kernel Source, we must have a build script to compile our kernel.

- Before creating a build script, we must determine the compatible compilers we will use to build our kernel.

- Run ```make kernelversion``` inside the kernel root to check your kernel version.

<img src="./screenshots/5.png">

- In my case, the kernel version is **5.4,** which is [qGKI](https://github.com/ravindu644/Android-Kernel-Tutorials?tab=readme-ov-file#-understanding-non-gki-qgki--gki-kernels).

- You can find full information about **choosing the correct compiler for your kernel version** [here](./toolchains/) (based on my experience, btw).

  - **‚ùóMediatek users,** read [this](https://github.com/ravindu644/Android-Kernel-Tutorials/tree/main/toolchains#additional-notes).

- Next, go to [build_scripts](./build_scripts/), choose the appropriate script, download it, and place it inside your kernel's root directory.

<img src="./screenshots/7.png">

- Keep in mind that **you don't need to manually download any of these** since my build scripts handle everything for you :)

- **‚ùóIf your device is Samsung Exynos, it doesn't support compiling the kernel in a separated 'out' directory. So, [edit your build script like this](./patches/001.nuke_out.patch)**

<hr>

### Notes :
- Replace `your_defconfig` to your current defconfig which is located in `arch/arm64/configs` In GKI kernels, it's normally `gki_defconfig`

- But just in case, make sure to check `arch/arm64/configs` or `arch/arm64/configs/vendor`

- If your defconfig is located in the `arch/arm64/configs` directory, just replace `your_defconfig` with the name of your defconfig.

- If your defconfig is located in the `arch/arm64/configs/vendor` directory, replace `your_defconfig` like this:
  
  - `vendor/name_of_the_defconfig`
  - Example patch: [here](./patches/005.edit-defconfig.patch)


### 02. Edit the Makefile.

- If you find these variables: ```REAL_CC``` or ```CFP_CC``` in your "Makefile", remove them from the "Makefile", then Search for "wrapper" in your Makefile. If there's a line related to a Python file, remove that entire line/function as well.

    - Example patch of removing the wrapper: [click here](./patches/004.remove_gcc%20wrapper.patch)

- Search ```CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG``` and replace it with ```CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE```

    - Example patch of fix -fstack-protector-strong not supported by compiler: [click here](./patches/003.fix_fstack-protector-strong-not-supported-by-compiler.patch)

<hr>

### 03. Now, grant the executable permissions to ```build_xxxx.sh``` using this command.
  ```
  chmod +x build_xxxx.sh
  ```
### 04. Finally, run the build script using this command :
  ```
./build_xxxx.sh
```

<img src="./screenshots/8.png">

- When you run the script for the first time, it will begin to install all the necessary dependencies and start downloading the required toolchains, depending on your kernel version.

- Make sure not to interrupt the first run. If it gets interrupted somehow, delete the `toolchains` folder from "~/" and try again: ```rm -rf ~/toolchains```

<img src="./screenshots/9.png">

### After the initial run is completed, the kernel should start building, 

<img src="./screenshots/11.png">

### and the "menuconfig" should appear.

<img src="./screenshots/10.png">

- **Additional notes:**
    - Press space bar to enable/disable or enable as a module \<M>.
    - You can completely ignore anything displayed as `warning:`
      - Eg: `warning: ignoring unsupported character '`
